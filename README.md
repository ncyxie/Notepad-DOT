# Notepad DOT

## Latest Information

**Notepad DOT (based on .NET Framework) is discontinued.** I strongly suggest to use [Notepad DOT Qt](https://github.com/ncyxie/Notepad-DOT-Qt) (has almost all features, compared to Notepad DOT) based on Qt framework (written in C++ language), it is much more stable, lighter on resources and it runs on Windows and Linux operating systems.

## Introduction

**Notepad DOT** is an open-source, lightweight and customizable text editor.
It has all basic notepad functions and more customisation junk. 
It is for everyday life, from newbies to advanced users. 
As it is open source, you can modify it and even make it better.
