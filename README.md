## IMPORTANT!

**Notepad DOT (based on .NET Framework) is discontinued and no longer maintained.** I strongly suggest to use [Notepad DOT Qt](https://github.com/ncyxie/Notepad-DOT-Qt) which is much more efficient, refined, and supports a wider variety of operating systems.

## Introduction

**Notepad DOT** is an open-source, lightweight and customizable text editor. It has all the basic notepad features combined with more customization options. It is designed for everyday life, from newbies to advanced users.
