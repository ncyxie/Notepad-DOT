# Notepad DOT

## Latest Information

**Notepad DOT (based on .NET Framework) is discontinued.** I started building Notepad DOT based on Qt (C++) and it works on Linux and Windows operating systems.

## Introduction

**Notepad DOT** is an open source, lightweight and customizable text editor.
It has all basic notepad functions and more customisation junk. 
It is for everyday life, from newbies to advanced users. 
As it is open source, you can modify it and even make it better.

## Download

[Download Notepad DOT Stable](https://github.com/ncyxie/Notepad-DOT/releases/)

[Download Notepad DOT Beta](https://github.com/ncyxie/Notepad-DOT-Beta/releases/)

Stable (Release) is recommended version for everyday use, least bugs.
Beta (Pre-Release) has latest features, but it may contain bugs.
Think wisely before choosing between those two. :)

## FAQ

1. **Why did you decided to make a notepad?**

Friend recommended me to do it, and it is fun to mess up with files.

2. **Can I "kang" a little of this Notepad code?**

Lmao, sure. This is why it is open-source. Do not hesitate, make it better :).

3. **Does this Notepad runs on Linux?**

Unfortunately, this edition, no. This application edition runs only on Windows OS.
Use [Notepad DOT Qt](https://github.com/ncyxie/Notepad-DOT-Qt) for Linux (or Windows) instead.

4. **What are this Notepad system requirements?**

No special requirements are needed, even very low-end PC can run this application, 
but make sure you run Windows OS (minimum 7, but 10 is recommended).

5. **How different is this Notepad compared to Windows (default) notepad?**

It has almost every Windows (default) notepad functions, but Notepad DOT has some 
extra good and useful goodies, which Windows (default) notepad doesn't have.
I call it a Windows (default) notepad and Microsoft Word hybrid. :)
