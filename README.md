but you are free to modify it, and make run on your desired OS.

No special requirements are needed, even junk PC can run this application, 
but make sure you run Windows OS (minimum 7, but 10 is recommended).

No, it is not even possible. But if you still get any kind of detection, 
please add an exception to your anti-virus for `Notepad DOT.exe` or
