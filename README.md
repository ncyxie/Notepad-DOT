No special requirements are needed, even junk PC can run this application, 
but make sure you run Windows OS (7 or higher recommended).

5. **Is this Notepad a virus?**

No, it is not even possible. But if you still get any kind of detection, 
please add an exception to your anti-virus for `Notepad DOT.exe` or
whatever you named Notepad DOT (or the folder it is in).
If you still do not trust me, you can compile application yourself.
